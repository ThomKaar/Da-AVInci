Merry Christmas Makena!

Maybe a happy Thanksgiving is closer to when you will first see this document.

There are instructions in the my-app and server folders if you want to run the site locally.

Of course you're totally free to edit the codebase however you wish.

I'm kind of kicking myself for showing you the website in an unfinished state this past Monday.
I feel like the gift has lost some of the magic and shock to it.
So I thought adding in a few poems might be something you wouldn't expect.
I'll try my best to keep most of them from being sappy, aside from 'Sweet'.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomKaar/Da-AVInci.git
```
----
### Front End Setup
Enter front end folder, install dependencies, and run the front end.
```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run serve
```
---
The site should be reachable at localhost:8080

### Back End Setup
Enter back end folder, install dependencies, and run the back end.
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

The server is at localhost:3000

# Important urls

localhost:8080 - main site that others will see

localhost:8080/editSite - the way you edit the main site, I can show you how it works, hopefully it won't be too confusing but it might be.
You can edit the side bar contents, upload images, or choose which items on the left display images in the gallery.
