Merry Christmas Makena!

Maybe a happy Thanksgiving is closer to when you will first see this document.

There are instructions in the my-app and server folders if you want to run the site locally.

Of course you're totally free to edit the codebase however you wish.

I'm kind of kicking myself for showing you the website in an unfinished state this past Monday.
I feel like the gift has lost some of the magic and shock to it.
So I thought adding in a few poems might be something you wouldn't expect.
I'll try my best to keep most of them from being sappy.

### Sweet

Sweet are her hands

For her fingertips curl into threads and cords of silk

For her knuckles have been grazed with technicolor spots

For her palms in the cool of morning lay open inviting mine
