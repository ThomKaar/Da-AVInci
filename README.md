Merry Christmas Makena!

Maybe a happy Thanksgiving is closer to when you will first see this document.

There are instructions in the my-app and server folders if you want to run the site locally.

Of course you're totally free to edit the codebase however you wish.

I'm kind of kicking myself for showing you the website in an unfinished state this past Monday.
I feel like the gift has lost some of the magic and shock to it.
So I thought adding in a few poems might be something you wouldn't expect.
I'll try my best to keep most of them from being sappy, aside from the last one.

### the treated tree

shallow rooted isolate trunk
sweats glistening beads from its sprinkler
green leaves in the valley
of burnt browns and drought yellows

sway in the wind of dust
cresting the natural hills
to buffet the synthetically
organic designer bark

nestled in a bed of mulch
a bed of stinky shit
dirty work to raise something successful 
in a valley that should be dead

### Sweet

Sweet are her hands

For her fingertips curl into threads and cords of silk

For her knuckles have been grazed with technicolor spots

For her palms in the cool of morning lay open inviting mine



---------

last winter i slipped and fell on a knife
the blade slit open my back exposing my thoractic spine who knew i had a spine
the wound bled it liked to bleed
small streams slid down my body

on the floor i rolled over into an unnoticed dusting of salt
the sting mocked my inadequacy 
to keep my house tidy and cared for 
the wound bled and i waited for it stop bleeding

it bled and i lost strength
it bled and i lost vision
it bled and i lost conciousness
it bled and i lost blood

there was a coal miner whose father was a doctor grime found home on his face
much cheaper were his charcoal caked hands to sew up my back
i could walk and see but i was sick
the charcoal had turned from dark to pale festering to infection

there was an old medic from an old war
she poured booze into my festering wound to clean it
its sting mocked my self control
her price for suture was too much so i bled again

there was a commune whose sizes and smiles could numb me
an anesthesia so i could walk and see and feel
but at night they would go away while i lie awake tired of the bleeding
12 hours a day isnt bad though

i found complacency a dear friend
i am tired and the wound continues to bleed
but i stitch myself each morning
and by night it bleeds again

it bled and i lost strength
it bled and i lost vision
it bled and i lost conciousness
it bled and i lost blood

i was tired but the wound bled
there was a surgeon from a line of butchers
the surgeon said to open the wound wider
and said i had to do it

the wound bled and i waited for it to stop bleeding
pulling my skin apart small streams now rivers exposing my ocipatal bone
the surgeon poured wine into my gapping wound
its sting mocked my inadequacy but the wound was clean

the surgeon said the work was done
and sewed the wound with new suture
the suture frays when i slip and fall
but the surgeon is there

i found the surgeon a dear friend
i am tired and the wound continues to bleed
but i am stitched each morning
and by night it bleeds again
