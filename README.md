Merry Christmas Makena!

Maybe a happy Thanksgiving is closer to when you will first see this document.

There are instructions in the my-app and server folders if you want to run the site locally.

Of course you're totally free to edit the codebase however you wish.

It's Sunday Nov. 10th around 11:15pm when I'm writing this document.
I think you're probably finishing up Camp Flog Gnaw right now and having to deal with all of that traffic.
I'm going to try and write a few thoughts down each time I spend a bit working on the site
until I show it to you again.
I wrote a poem last fall about the moment before two people hold hands for the first time.
If you think that's stupid text me and stop reading this because it's going to get even more stupid.
Winter I revised the poem and cut it down quite a bit to just about someone's hands.
Tonight I revised it again, but about your hands. Here it is

Sweet

Sweet are her hands,
For her fingertips curl into threads and ropes of silk
For her knuckles have been grazed with technicolor spots
For her palms in the cool of morning lay open reaching for mine
