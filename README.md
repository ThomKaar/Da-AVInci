Merry Christmas Makena!

Maybe a happy Thanksgiving is closer to when you will first see this document.

There are instructions in the my-app and server folders if you want to run the site locally.

Of course you're totally free to edit the codebase however you wish.

I'm kind of kicking myself for showing you the website in an unfinished state this past Monday.
I feel like the gift has lost some of the magic and shock to it.
So I thought adding in a few poems might be something you wouldn't expect.
I'll try my best to keep most of them from being sappy, aside 'Sweet'.

### the treated tree

shallow rooted isolate trunk
sweats glistening beads from its sprinkler
green leaves in the valley
of burnt browns and drought yellows

sway in the wind of dust
cresting the natural hills
to buffet the synthetically
organic designer bark

nestled in a bed of mulch
a bed of stinky shit
dirty work to raise something successful 
in a valley that should be dead
